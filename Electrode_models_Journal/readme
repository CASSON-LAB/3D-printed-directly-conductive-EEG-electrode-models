This folder contains 3D-printed directly conductive EEG electrodes with different designs


For each STL file, we include two models for each type, because we printed the electrodes pairwise using these setup. The reason is: printing more than 2 model in one run could provide better printing quality, giving better printing details to the small snap connectors on the top
