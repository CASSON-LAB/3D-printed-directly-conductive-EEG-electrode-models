# 3D-printed-directly-conductive-EEG-electrode-models

1. The models in this branch are: 3D printed directly conductive and flexible EEG electrode models (we published in IEEE FLEPS2022 conference proceedings)

2. The folder "Electrode_models_Journal" contains 9 different models: 
  (1). Flat circle electrodes: with small, medium, large contact areas;
  (2). Short fingered electrodes: with small, medium, large contact areas;
  (3). Long fingered electrodes: with small medium, large contact areas;
  
     We investigated more effects of different designs of EEG electrode.
  
 3. More systematica studies have been published in "Sensors and Actuators A: Physical", the models are in "Electrode_models_Journal"
